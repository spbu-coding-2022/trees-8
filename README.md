## About

It is a library that provides kotlin implementations of 3 binary search trees data
structures: [BS tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree), [AVL tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_trees), [Red-black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red‚Äìblack_tree).
It also provides storing BSTs in either plain `.json` files, `SQLite`
or `neo4j` databases.

## Roadmap

- [x] License
- [x] CI
- [x] Realized all types of trees
- [x] Added tests
- Storing with:
    - [x] Neo4j
    - [x] Sqlite
    - [x] json
- [x] GUI

## Building

To build this project run

```bash
  ./gradlew build
```

## How to use

If you need access to trees, see official [documentation](/DOCS.md)

To run our tree viewer

```bash
./gradlew run
```

The viewer is currently only able to open trees stored in a json file.
Create an empty .json file and open it in the application, enter any name for the tree
and it will be created. You can drag and drop tree nodes, add and remove values,
save the state of the tree for later loading. If there are available trees in the .json file, they will be in the
dropdown list.
